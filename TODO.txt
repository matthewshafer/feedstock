Things to do in no preticular order

Cacher
	finish file checking
	needs a purge function
	check if writeable
	
Database

	check for drafts
	
Visions
	--
	
Themes
	get them set up in a way where they can access data that they would need
	possibly calling functions? see how other things use themes
	another possibility is to pass them all the data they could use and then they can handle what to do with it, probably not good though
	A better idea is to pass them an object we created that allows them to get all the info they need
	Visions could create something like $data.  themes could call $this->data-getPosts().  this sounds like a better idea.
	
router
	function to return a specific piece of the uri
	
templateEngine
	Checking for null pagedata in render()
	
	Categories and tags need to have a null check
	
fileServe
